## Warning for MacOS users!

If you're experiencing difficulties writing files to microcontrollers, the issue doesn't lie with the IDE or CircuitPython, but with a recognized problem in MacOS 14 (Sonoma).

-   MacOS 14.0 ~ 14.3: For solutions to `Errno 5` errors when saving code on your microcontroller, refer to [this link](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/8449#issuecomment-1743922060).
-   MacOS 14.4: If you're facing slow file writing speeds, consult [this link](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/8918).
